2.  ``` -409 ```

3.  ``` True ```

4.  ``` None ```

5.  ``` -13.0 ```


## Part 2 ~ Basic Math

1.  ``` 12 + 5 - 2 ```

2.  ``` 4 * 9.0 ```

3.  ``` --16 ```

4.  ``` 9 / 3 ```

5.  ``` 10 // 3 ```

6.  ``` 10.0 // 4.0 ```

7.  ``` (2 + 5) * 4 ```

8.  ``` 2 + 5 * 4 ```

9.  ``` 4 ** 3 + 16 ```

10. ``` 2.1 ** 2.0 ```

11  ``` 2.2 * 4.0 ```


## Part 3 ~ Booleans and Comparison
Find the correct result of each comparison

1.  ``` 9 > 1 ```

2.  ``` 3.0 > 3.001 ```

3.  ``` 2 > 2 ```

4.  ``` 2 > +2 ```

5.  ``` 3 + 3 == 9 ```

6.  ``` True or False ```

7.  ``` True ```

8.  ``` not False ```

9.  ``` 3 > 4 or (2 < 3 and 9 > 10) ```

10. ``` not(4 > 3 and 100 > 6) ```

## Part 4 ~ Calculations and Types
For following exercise find both types of results and results.

1.  ``` 2 + 7.0 ```

2.  ``` 1 / 2 ```

3.  ``` 1 // 2 ```

4.  ``` 1/2 == 1//2 ```

5.  ``` round(3.4) ```

6.  ``` int(98.7) ```

7.  ``` 2.0 + 4.0 ```

8.  ``` 5*2 == 5.0 * 2.0 ```


## Part 5 ~ Strings
Find the correct results of following strings

1.  ``` "N" + "AU" ```

2.  ``` ("Go" * "3") + "Stallions!" ```

3.  ``` ("Go" * 3) + "Stallions!" ```

4.  ``` "Stallions"[2] ```

5.  ``` "Stallions"[5:] ```

6.  ``` "Stallions"[:5] ```

## Part 6 ~ More on Strings
Find the correct solutions of following questions. Use the variables that I have defined:
```Python
str1 = "Python is "
str2 = "so "
str3 = "much fun!"
```

> Hint: If I were you, I would consider the spaces too...

1.  ``` print(str1) ```

2.  ``` str1[0] ```

3.  ``` str1[-1] ```

4.  ``` len(str1) ```

5.  ```str1[len(str1)] ```

6.  ``` str1 + str2 + str3 ```

7.  ``` "t" in str3 ```

8.  ``` "t" in str1 ```

9.  ``` str3[1:3] ```

10. ``` str2[:-1] ```

11. ``` str4[1:10] ```

12. ``` (str1 + str2 + str3)[::-1] ```

## Part 7 ~ String Methods
Find the correct results of following questions about string methods. Using already defined variables:
```Python
str1 = "here comes the best part"
str2 = "methods of strings"
```

1.  ``` str1.upper() ```

2.  ``` str1 ```

3.  ``` str1.isupper() ```

4.  ``` str2.islower() ```

5.  
```Python 
str2 = str2.capitalize()
str2
```

6.  ```str2 = swapcase() ```

7.  ``` str1.index("e") ```

8.  ``` str1.index("n") ```

9.  ``` str1.find(e) ```

10. ``` str2.find("!") ```

11. ``` str1.count("e") ```

12. 
```Python
str1 = str1.replace("e", "x")
str1
```

13. ``` str2.replace("of" , "with") ```
