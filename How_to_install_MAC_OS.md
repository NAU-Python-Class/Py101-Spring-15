# How to Setup Python Environment on MAC OS

> We will be using python version 3.x in Enthought Canopy Python Distribution. Enthought Canopy provides the proper version of Python, so you don't need to worry about this if you are using Enthought. 

### Why Using Canopy?
Enthought Canopy includes:
* Python shell and file 
* Includes many packages other than built-in ones
* Scientific packages are also included such as;
    - Scipy
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Pandas
    - Ipyhton Notebook
* and an application, also called Canopy, which allows you to edit and run Python code.

> This Canopy application is similar to Python's built-in Idle editor, but is easier to use, more powerful, and suitable for use in your future Python projects.

> If you have further questions about the environment please contact with the instructor.

## Installation guide

To download Enthought Canopy on your Mac (Apple) machine, you should follow these steps:

* Visit the Enthought website's [download page](https://www.enthought.com/downloads/)
* The site should detect your operating system, but check that it shows "Mac OS X". We suggest downloading the 32-bit flavor for maximum graphics compatibility. Click the green "Download Canopy." button.
* Once the file has downloaded to your system, start by double-clicking the .dmg file to mount the image. Opening this file displays the installation window shown below. Canopy can be installed by dragging the Canopy icon to the Applications folder in the window, to the computer Desktop, or to another folder. If you drag it to the Applications folder, it will show as "Canopy" along with your other applications.

Once Canopy is copied to your system, the last step is to set up your Python environment. Double-clicking the Canopy icon in your Applications folder will start Canopy, and the application will guide you through the setup process.
