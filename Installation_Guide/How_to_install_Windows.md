# How to Setup Python Environment on Windows

> We will be using python version 3.x in Enthought Canopy Python Distribution. Enthought Canopy provides the proper version of Python, so you don't need to worry about this if you are using Enthought. 

### Why Using Canopy?
Enthought Canopy includes:
* Python shell and file 
* Includes many packages other than built-in ones
* Scientific packages are also included such as;
    - Scipy
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Pandas
    - Ipyhton Notebook
* and an application, also called Canopy, which allows you to edit and run Python code.

> This Canopy application is similar to Python's built-in Idle editor, but is easier to use, more powerful, and suitable for use in your future Python projects.

> If you have further questions about the environment please contact with the instructor.

## Installation guide

To download Enthought Canopy on your Windows machine, you should follow these steps:

* Visit the Enthought website's [download page](https://www.enthought.com/downloads/)
* The site should detect your operating system, but check that it shows "Windows". If you are running 32-bit Windows, be sure that you have selected the 32-bit flavor. (If you are running 64-bit Windows, you can download either flavor.) Click the green "Download Canopy." button.
*  In most cases (except as noted in the next bullet point), you will not need administrative privileges to install Canopy. Once the file has downloaded to your system, start the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file. Verify that the publisher is listed as Enthought, Inc. and click "Run." Follow the installer instructions and complete the installation.
