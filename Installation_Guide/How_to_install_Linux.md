# How to Setup Python Environment on Linux

> We will be using python version 3.x in Enthought Canopy Python Distribution. Enthought Canopy provides the proper version of Python, so you don't need to worry about this if you are using Enthought. 

### Why Using Canopy?
Enthought Canopy includes:
* Python shell and file 
* Includes many packages other than built-in ones
* Scientific packages are also included such as;
    - Scipy
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Pandas
    - Ipyhton Notebook
* and an application, also called Canopy, which allows you to edit and run Python code.

> This Canopy application is similar to Python's built-in Idle editor, but is easier to use, more powerful, and suitable for use in your future Python projects.

> If you have further questions about the environment please contact with the instructor.

## Installation guide

To download Enthought Canopy on your Linux machine, you should follow these steps:

* Visit the Enthought website's [download page](https://www.enthought.com/downloads/)
* The site should detect your operating system, but check that it shows "Linux", and that you select the flavor (32-bit or 64-bit) that corresponds to your Linux system installation. Click the green "Download Canopy." button.
* 
    Canopy for Linux is distributed as a self-extracting shell script. Once the file has downloaded to your system, the install can be started by executing the following command from within the download directory (the exact name "canopy-1.1.0-rh5-64.sh" may differ slightly, depending on which Canopy installer version you just downloaded):

bash canopy-1.1.0-rh5-64.sh
* The installer will present the Canopy End User License Agreement for approval. If you agree to the license, the next prompt is for the installation location. The default installation location is ~/Canopy.
