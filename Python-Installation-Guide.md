# Python Interpreter 3.4 Installation Guide 

Since we will use very basic elements of Python, Python Idle interpreter will be enough for us. For those of you who wants to go deep on Python after this class I would recommend other platforms that you can work on and make your job easier, but I said, Python Idle will be enough.

To install the Python interpreter [Click Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/) and choose according to your system.    __(Note that x86 stands for 32bit)__

After you download and install the file from the website, you will be able to reach the following:

* Python Interpreter
* Help Files(documentation)
* Command-line access
* Integrated DeveLopment Environment(IDLE) application
* Uninstaller
